# Instancer

Roblox library inspired by [Fusion](https://github.com/dphfox/Fusion) to programatically create instances, specifically meant for user interfaces.

This is completely untested. Like I literally just didn't test it and I'm going to upload a thousand different versions while I make my game and fix stuff. If you use it that's your fault.
